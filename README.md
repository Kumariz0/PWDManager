# Local password manager

This is a local password manager. My idea with this is that poeople without the code can't access it. that way it can be put on a UBS-stick that it is only accessible when it's pluged in. That only allows hackers to steal the data when the USB-stick is lost.
## Installation

Simply downlaod the Zip file out of the [Releases](https://github.com/Kumariz0/PWDManager/releases) Tab, unpack it and execute main.exe.
(This password manager is for windows only currently)


## Usage
