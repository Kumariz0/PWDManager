# Local password manager

This is a local password manager. My idea whith this is that poeople without the code can't acces it so it can be put on a UBS-stick that it is only accesible when it is pluged in. That only allows hackers to steal the zdata when the USB-stick is lost.
## Installation

Simply downlaod the EXE file out of the [Releases](https://github.com/Kumariz0/PWDManager/releases) Tab and execute it.


## Usage

TBA
